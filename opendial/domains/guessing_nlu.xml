	the user dialogue act. from the utterance, and one model to update the slots in accordance with 
	this dialogue act.

	The user dialogue act associated with each utterance is represented here as a list of 
	basic acts (such as "Confirm" or "Inform(...)").  This representation allows us to 
	capture the fact that an utterance such as "Yes, 3 tickets" contains both a confirmation
	and a new information about the number of tickets.
